# Statamic Livewire Filters

Statamic Livewire Filters is an add-on for Statamic that enables you to use Livewire to create "live" filters for your Statamic collections. It comprises a primary Livewire component and various standard filter components, which are designed to be easily editable to suit your project's needs. It allows you to filter your entries by almost any field you wish and display the results in a "live" manner, using the power of Livewire.
